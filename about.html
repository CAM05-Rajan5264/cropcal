<h3>About Cropping Calendar App</h3>
<p>An app to visualisie cropping calendars for selected regions. Once you make a selection of the region using drop-down menus, the calendar will be displayed.</p>
<p>This is a work in progress. There are a few issues that causes overlap in some cases. Planned additions include map display of selected regions, and display of associated climate data.</p>
